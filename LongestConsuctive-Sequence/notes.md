###Desccription
#Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
#You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

```Example 1:
Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9```

##Solution Explanation

```
[] Create an empty hash.
[ ] Insert all array elements to hash.
[ ] Do following for every element arr[i]
[ ] Check if this element is the starting point of a subsequence. To check this, simply look for arr[i] â€“ 1 in the hash, if not found, then this is the first element a subsequence.
If this element is the first element, then count the number of elements in the consecutive starting with this element. Iterate from arr[i] + 1 till the last element that can be found.
If the count is more than the previous longest subsequence found, then update this.```
